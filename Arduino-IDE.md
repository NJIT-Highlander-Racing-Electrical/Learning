# Getting Started with Arduino IDE

## 1. Download the Editor 

Downloading the Arduino IDE 2 is done through the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
If using a Windows Computer, choose the Download Option for "Win 10 and newer, 64 bits".

All of the default settings are sufficient, and this should only take a few miuntes.

## 3. Device Software Prompts
You may be prompted to install some device software and drivers from Adafruit Industries or Arduino after opening the Arduino IDE. These drivers are essential to communicating with connnected microcontrollers, so make sure you install them. 

## 4. (Optional) Dark Mode
You can set the IDE to dark mode via File -> Preferenecs -> Theme
