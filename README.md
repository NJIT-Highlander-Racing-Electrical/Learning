# Learning

This repository is dedicated to general learning materials to familiarize new students with the work Baja does. 

## [1. Getting Started with Arduino IDE](Arduino-IDE.md)

Arduino is a very common open-source electronics platform in the ECE world. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language and the Arduino Software (IDE).

#### What is an IDE?

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software tool that helps programmers write, test, and debug code more easily. It combines features like a text editor, code suggestions, error checking, and tools to run your codeâ€”all in one place.

## [2. Programming an ESP32 Microcontroller](ESP32.md)

Some standard Arduino boards, like the Arduino Uno, can be programmed without any extra work. However, ESP32 boards require another installation to the IDE to work with the IDE.
